        All buttons
            <FunctionName>OnAction_ECAM</FunctionName>
                it is not necessary to call Office.actions.associate("OnAction_ECAM", OnAction_ECAM); as this manifest makes this association
        <FunctionFile resid="Commands.Url"/>
            commands.html i.e., parent page
                loads command.js
                    async function OnAction_ECAM(event)
    Click any ribbon button
        Office.onReady()

        call OnAction_ECAM
            office.js passes an event parameter
                event.source['id'] is the ribbon button's id
